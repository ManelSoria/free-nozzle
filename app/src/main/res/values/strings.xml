    <string name="gas_properties">You need to set the gas properties, too. You can choose between its molecular mass or its specific constant. Don\'t forget to enter its adiabatic constant too!</string>

    <string name="study_intro">We\'re looking at supersonic nozzles, so there needs to be a throat with M=1. In order to do the remaining calculus you need to enter either the mass flux or the throat\'s diameter, along with the pressure in the exit and in the ambient.</string>
    <string name="study_note">Cases when M=1 is not reached in the nozzle throat will be done in the future, so please enter a value of Pe that is smaller than </string>

    <string name="summerfield_info">Keep in mind that if the ratio Pe/Pa violates any of the Summerfield conditions, like Pe/Pa >= 0.4 or Pe/Pa >= (1.88*Me - 1)^-0.64, the flow inside the nozzle will experiment separation, making any calculus made here invalid.</string>
