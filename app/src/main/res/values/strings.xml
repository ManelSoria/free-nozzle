    <string name="temp_comb">Temperature (K):</string>
    <string name="gas_properties">You need to set the gas properties, too. You can choose between its molecular mass or its specific constant. Don\'t forget to enter its adiabatic constant too!</string>

    <string name="study_intro">We\'re looking at supersonic nozzles, so there needs to be a throat with M=1. In order to do the remaining calculus you need to enter either the mass flux or the throat\'s diameter, along with the ambient pressure.</string>
    <string name="study_note">Cases when M=1 is not reached in the nozzle will be done in the future.</string>
