===========

A little Android app to help in tow fundamental rocket nozzle operations: Design and Study them.

-The Design part calculates from some initial conditions the diameters of the throat and the exit of
the nozzle.

-On the other hand, the Study one gets the resultant thrust this nozzle can output from its geometric
characteristics.

It has to be noted that the app is still in an alpha state! It is feature complete, but it can (has)
some errors, and it does not do input checking, for instance.

I plan to fix al of this if I have time, but I don't have that much time.
